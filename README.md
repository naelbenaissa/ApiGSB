# ApiDemo - Laravel API

The "ApiGSB" project was a significant milestone in my learning journey as a web developer. It allowed me to solidify my API development skills by applying fundamental concepts and getting familiar with popular technologies in the web development industry.

As the cornerstone of my project, the ApiGSB API not only helped me put into practice the theoretical concepts covered in my courses but also served as a testing ground to validate my newly acquired knowledge and skills. By working on this project, I had the opportunity to gain a deep understanding of HTTP requests, data management, and the implementation of CRUD operations in the specific context of Laravel.

## Features

- **Endpoints:** The API provides endpoints to interact with various resources.
  
- **CRUD Operations:** Implements CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to demonstrate basic functionality.

## Installation and Configuration

1. **Clone the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nbena69/ApiDemo.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd ApiDemo
   composer install
   ```

3. **Configure the database:**
   - Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
   - Configure the database settings in the `.env` file.

4. **Run migrations and seed the database:**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
